# 🧠 Tristan's Dev Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio site — a clean, modern, and animated developer bio built with 💻 **Next.js 14**, 🎨 **TailwindCSS**, 🧠 **Sanity CMS**, and 🌀 **Framer Motion**.

This site is where I show off my work, talk a bit about what I’m into, and wave at visitors like a polite nerd emoji.
